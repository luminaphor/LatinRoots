# LatinRoots

This is a work in Progress, its kinda messy, and there is still some functionality I intend to add.

It cleans up the .txt file to extract the roots and their respective definitions,
it then cleans up the remaining roots and their definitions so they can be used.
The actual usernamegen program then picks two roots at random, merges them together in all possible combinations
and displays those combinations along with the definitions of each root.

The user can continue to run the program and then type "Done" when finished.
The favorites/saving functionality have not been added yet.
